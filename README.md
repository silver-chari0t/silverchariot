# **BYI ;;**
- I am a tad bit shy when it comes to talking to new people or new friends.
- Sometimes I can say things without thinking about the impact, I will apologize if it's uncomfortable.
- I'm not the best at comforting, so people venting to me can make me feel uncomfortable in a way.
- Please use tone tags if we're not close.
- I can make pretty terrible jokes, such as "kys/kms/die", but I would never have any ill intention behind it.
- Sometimes making friends can be awkward for me, as I can rarely keep up a good convo.

# **PONYTOWN ;;**
- If my name has C+H in it, feel free to cuddle! But if it doesn't, please ask me instead unless my name says otherwise.
- I don't roleplay on Ponytown, really. Pleasse don't try to force me into a roleplay, I will ignore you.
- Do not copy or take inspiration off my ponies without asking!
- I don't like being cuddled with so many people, especially if I'm not close with you.
- I do not want to customize a random's pony, so please do not ask me.
- I do not mind boops/kisses, but if it's constant booping I will mind.

🌙 = *My usual status. I'm usually up for talking to people at this point, but I could be offtab.*
